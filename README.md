# Three In A Row

Three In A Row is a simple but fun site that allows two friends to relax and enjoy a fun game together. The aim of the game is to get three of your own symbols in a row, and each player is represented by either an "X" or an "O". When one of the players manages to get three in a row the game will, unless it ended in a draw, proclaim a winner. The game features fun sounds and can, through the "Let's play!-button" always be reset if so desired.
